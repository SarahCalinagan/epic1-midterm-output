Making this mandala art was difficult to make when it is hard to create ideas. The idea of my work is an interpretation of what I think of my favorite pair from the show Arcane: League of Legends -- Ekko and Jinx. The colors repesent each person (green for Ekko and blue for Jinx). Jinx' design is supposed to be chaotic but beautiful but just as her mental state, it spirals down and in the end the art represents a bomb. Ekko's design was supposed to be a clock where the bomb is in the center of a clock so the title of the pair "Timebomb" would be reperesented clearly. But I couldn't do the clock so I just settled with the wings of a firefly(firelight) and turn them into a flower because the flower represents life where Ekko's group is one. 

Then the combination of the two forms a beautiful art that despite their differences, these two would have been powerful and can move as one when joined together.
